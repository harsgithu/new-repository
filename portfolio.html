<h1> We have our monkey that will be catching bananas! Bt be careful, we have a hidden hedgehog that falls once in a while.

<h1> Our first guess was Tropical Islands because the temperatur matched the graph. But we noticed that the graph for 
<h1> the sound was wrong because sound can't be a negative value. The correct answer was the Inland Forrests.
